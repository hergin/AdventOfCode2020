# AdventOfCode2020

* This repository is my attempt at solving the puzzles of [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
* I have utilized a python container to run puzzles, you can do it too or just install python.
* The solutions are no where near optimized or made readable. This is not even the purpose. The reason is just to find the answer.
* I posted the answers as well because 1) you can find answers all around anyway, and 2) you don't get point for late answers.
